# cutscene

In-engine cutscenes played from a cue file: camera shots and dollies, a cast of the scene's own rows
walking, facing, playing clips and speaking lines, fades, letterbox bars, camera shake, sound,
music, waits that hold the timeline, skip for every seat, and a scene change at the end. The same on
every seat, including one that joins mid-scene.

## Why use it

Use cutscene for an intro, a story beat, a boss entrance, a mission briefing, a level fly-over or an
ending, played with the game's own characters in the game's own world rather than a video. One row
drives it, so every seat sees the same shot on the same frame, and a cue file is plain data a
designer edits.

## How it works

**Server half (`cutscene.sim.ts`).** `cutscene(height)` is the `cutscene` kind, built from the
ground's height (`height(w, x, z)`, terrain3d's `heightAt`, or `() => 0` for flat ground). The scene
holds one `cutscene` row (its prefab is `{}`) and any `mark` rows, named spots `{ name, at }`.

- The row keeps two clocks: `e` always advances (shots, fades, bars, shakes and lines run on it, so a
  dolly keeps moving through a wait) and `t`, the cue clock, which a `wait` holds. A cue fires on the
  first step `t` reaches its `at`.
- When the scene starts, each cast member (`cast: { name: { kind, name } }`) is matched to the first
  row of that kind with that `name`. The cutscene directs a member by writing `direct { walk, face,
  play, gesture }` on its row, which the member's own `tick` obeys; while `direct` is set the member
  ignores its player's stick.
- Points are `[x, z]` on the ground or `[x, up, z]` above it, so raised ground raises the mark and the
  camera with it. A target is a cast name, a mark's name, or a point.
- `start` (closed: only the game's rule calls it) or `auto` starts it; `reset` puts it back to before
  it started; `skip` is open, so any seat skips for every seat, and the row plays the rest through
  inside one step, leaping quiet stretches, so the cast ends where a played scene would leave them.
- At the end `direct` is null on the cast (control returns) and, with `go`, every row of the kinds
  `kinds` names is sent `go(go, ...arrive)`, moving the seats to the next scene.

`check(name, file)` throws a sentence naming the file and cue for anything it cannot play, and every
misspelt name throws at the start. `pose(d, rows, height)` is the camera a shot draws; `shaken` the
shake; `level` a fade or bar ramp; `longest(file)` the most seconds a file can play.

**Browser half (`cutscene.plugin.ts`).** While a shot runs it claims render3d's camera
(`render3d.claim`) and places it from `pose` plus `shaken`, read off the rows every frame (nothing
eases on the page), and gives the camera and its fov back when the scene ends. It draws the bars
(`cutscene.top`, `cutscene.bottom`), the fade veil (`cutscene.veil`) and the spoken line
(`cutscene.line`, `who: text`) on ui's panels. A `prepare` cue hands the land a point to make ready
ahead of a cut there.

## The cue file

A loader `json` entry with `end`, `go?`, `arrive?`, `auto?`, `reach`, `stop`, `head`, `fov`, `pace`,
`limit`, `cast` and `cues`, each cue `{ at, do, ... }`:

| do | fields | what it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `play` | who, clip, holds, rate | a whole-body clip on the member |
| `gesture` | who, clip | an upper-body clip |
| `walk` | who, to, gear, limit? | walks to `to`, at a gear clip's speed or `pace` |
| `face` | who, to \| null | turns toward `to` while not walking; null lets go |
| `say` | who, text, for, voice? | the line for `for` seconds, with an optional voice cue |
| `wait` | who \| "line" | holds the cue clock until the walk is done or the line has gone |
| `shot` | name, pos, look, fov?, over, follows?, frame? | a cut (`over` 0) or a dolly; `follows` a member, `frame: "body"` in its own axes |
| `fade` | to, over | to black (1) or clear (0) |
| `bars` | on, over | letterbox in (1) or out (0) |
| `shake` | over, amp | camera jitter decaying to nothing |
| `sound` | cue, where? \| who? | a sound at a place or from a member |
| `music` | name \| "" | the row's `music` |
| `prepare` | where | the land made ready ahead of a cut there |

## Using it

1. In the game's sim, add `cutscene(heightAt)` (or `cutscene(() => 0)`) and `mark` to its kinds.
2. List `cutscene` after `render3d` and before `chasecamera3d` and `ui` in `plugins` (otherwise its
   tick throws), add a `cutscene` row, and give `world.cutscene: { script, kinds, settle, tremor,
   mods }`: the cue file, the kinds a cast member may be, the seconds of each quiet stretch a skip
   steps through, the shake's `[weight, rate]` per axis, and the mods.
3. List the audio ledger's actor ahead of the cutscene row, so its sounds are stamped with their own
   step.
4. Make each cast kind obey `direct` in its `tick` (walk with walker's `seek`, face, play and gesture
   through anim), and give it the acts `advance(dt)` and `go(scene, ...arrive)`.
5. Give ui's prefab the `cutscene.top`, `cutscene.bottom`, `cutscene.veil` and `cutscene.line`
   panels and styles, if the file uses bars, fades or lines.
6. Call the row's `start` act from the game's rule, or set `auto`.

## Plugins it works with

- **render3d**: the camera it claims and places.
- **chasecamera3d**: listed after cutscene, it takes the camera back the frame the cutscene lets go.
- **ui**: the bars, veil and line are drawn on its panels.
- **audio**: the mod `audio.cutscene.ts` (`world.cutscene.mods: { play: 'audio' }`) sounds sound and
  voice cues on the ledger.
- **terrain3d**: the mod `terrain3d.cutscene.ts` (`mods: { land: 'terrain3d' }`) stands the page's
  points on the land, and `prepare` readies the land ahead of a cut; the server half is built on
  terrain3d's `heightAt`.
- **anim** and **walker**: a cast member plays its clips through anim and walks by walker's `seek`.
- **loader**: the cue file is a `json` entry.
- **scenemanager**: `go` at the end moves every seat to the next scene.
