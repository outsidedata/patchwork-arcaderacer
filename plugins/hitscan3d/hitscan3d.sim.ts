// hitscan3d: a shot along a line through a 3D world, answered with the first thing it meets: the
// ground, a solid standing on it, or a body; and, when the shot carries a hurt, the body it meets is
// hurt. The server half (this file) answers; the browser half (`hitscan3d.plugin.ts`) tells a page's
// shot which step it was aimed at.
//
// What a line meets is asked of other plugins through mods (`addons/scenemanager`), each named in
// `world.hitscan3d.mods`, and each optional:
//   ground   `(w, from, dir, far) → { t, normal } | undefined`, the first point of the ground along
//            the line (`terrain3d.hitscan3d.ts`).
//   solids   `(w, from, dir, far) → { x, z, radius, base, tall? }[]`, every solid standing on it, a
//            trunk or a boulder, whose circle the line's path over the ground crosses within `far`:
//            an upright cylinder about (x, z) from `base` up `tall`, or without end when it has none
//            (`scatter3d.hitscan3d.ts`).
//   bodies   `(w) → { id, kind, pos, shapes }[]`, every body that could be hit, `pos` its feet and
//            `shapes` what of it a shot meets, in the world, each named by its `part`:
//              `{ part, cylinder: { pos, radius, height } }`, upright, from its foot `pos` up
//              `height` (`walker.hitscan3d.ts`);
//              `{ part, capsule: { a, b, radius } }`, every point within `radius` of the segment from
//              `a` to `b`, one sphere when they are one point (`ragdoll3d.hitscan3d.ts`).
// `t` is metres along `dir` from `from`, `dir` any length (it is normalised), `normal` the surface's,
// unit length. `far` is the most metres a line is asked along.
//
// The rest of `world.hitscan3d`:
//   kinds    `{ <kind>: { off?, tall? } }`: the kinds of body a shot can hit, and no other. A row
//            whose field `off` names is truthy (a body lying dead) is not hit. A row carrying a number
//            in the field `tall` names is that tall: its cylinders reach that high over their foot (a
//            crouch); a capsule is where the body's pose puts it and is never changed by it.
//   rewind   steps: how far back a shot may be aimed.
//
// Aiming back. A seat sees the other bodies where the last packet it took put them, some steps
// behind the server by the time its shot arrives, so a shot is checked against the bodies as that
// packet held them. That needs a `hitscan3d` row, made by one actor entry: its `after` counts the
// steps in its field `n` and keeps every body's feet and shapes at the end of each of the last
// `rewind` steps, under the `n` the step's packet carries. A page reads `n` off the row in the packet
// it draws and hands it to the shot (`seen` on the browser half), and `shoot`'s `seen` puts each body
// back where it stood then; a `seen` older than `rewind` steps is taken as the oldest kept, and a
// `seen` newer than the last step, or one given in a scene with no `hitscan3d` row, as now. What is
// kept is the plugin's own memory, one per row, built from the rows as the steps run, and sent to no
// seat: a truth rebuilt by replaying its steps keeps it again. A body is only put back, never
// brought back: one that has ended since is not there, and whether it is `off` is read off its row now.
//
// `shoot(w, from, dir, far, { skip, seen, bodies, grow, hurt })` is the first thing the line meets
// within `far`: `{ t, point, normal, what }`, `what` being `ground`, `solid` or `body`, with `id`,
// `kind` and `part` when it is a body, the part of the shape it met, or undefined when it meets
// nothing. `skip` is ids of bodies it passes through (the shooter); `bodies: false` passes through
// every body, for a line only the ground and the solids stop (a camera kept out of a hill); `grow` is
// metres every shape is taken wider by, and a cylinder longer by at both ends, 0 when left out, for a
// round with a size of its own. A line starting inside a shape meets it where it leaves it; a line
// starting inside a skipped body passes it by.
// `hurt` is what the shot does to a body it meets, `{ damage, by, … }`: `damage` the harm, a number,
// or `{ <part>: number }`, the harm by the part met, which must name it; `by` the row that shot; and
// anything else the weapon carries (a knock, an impulse). With one, the body met is hurt: its row's
// `hit` act is called, as a rule's (seat −1), with a `Struck`, `{ ...hurt, damage, part, point, dir,
// what: 'body' }`, `damage` the harm as a number, `dir` the unit way the line runs. Without one, the
// shot only answers.
//
// `Struck` is what every `hit` act is handed, whoever hurts the row: a shot's, as above; a round's
// splash, `what: 'splash'`, `part` null (`plugins/volley3d`); a rule's burst, `what: 'blast'`, `part`
// null; a car's chassis, `what: 'car'`, with its `speed`, m/s (`plugins/box3dvehicle`). `point` is
// where it was struck from, or met, and `dir` the unit way the harm travels. A `hit` act tells one
// hurt from another by its `what`.
// `strike(w, row, struck)` is how a row is hurt: its `hit` act called, as a rule's (seat −1), with a
// `Struck`; a rule's burst hurts each row it reaches with it.
//
// `hittable(w)` is every body a shot can hit now: of a kind `kinds` lists, none lying `off`, each
// cylinder as tall as its row's `tall` field when it carries one.
// `sees(w, from, to)` is whether nothing of the ground or the solids stands between two points:
// bodies do not block a sight.
//
// hitscan3d answers other plugins through its own mods: `hitscan3d.volley3d.ts` hands volley3d
// `shoot` and `bodies`, so launched rounds meet, and hurt, what a shot meets.
