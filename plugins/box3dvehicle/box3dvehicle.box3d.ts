// box3dvehicle's mod for box3d: the kinds a car is made of, built from the scene's
// `world.box3dvehicle` (`box3dvehicle.sim.ts`), which a scene hands box3d by naming it in
// `world.box3d.mods.kinds`. A car's rows say which Vehicle each part is of and which corner each
// wheel and joint is: the `box3dvehicle` row that lists it, its `vehicle`, and the part's place in
// `wheels` or `joints`.
//   the chassis  the body's box and, where the body has a `cabin`, the cabin's hull, both of the
//                body's `friction`; a body with no cabin is the one box. Its mass, centre of mass and
//                inertia set outright (`inertia`).
//   a wheel      a ball of its axle's `wheel.radius`, with contact events on, so box3d writes what it
//                touches; its mass and inertia set outright, a tyre's of its `width` (`wheelInertia`);
//                and `allowFastRotation`, since Box3D otherwise holds a body to a quarter turn a
//                step, 47 rad/s at 60 steps a second, which is 19 m/s on a 0.42 m wheel in any gear.
//                A ball rolls on one point that never changes: a cylinder is a hull of flat sides in
//                Box3D, and each side meeting the ground is a bump, several a step at speed, which
//                shake the car and let it creep on a slope where a ball sleeps.
//   a joint      a wheel joint from the chassis to the wheel's inner face, both frames turned a
//                quarter about z, the chassis's on the axis below the corner's mount where the
//                wheel's face is at full droop (`frameA`); Box3D's spring off and its limits the ends
//                of the travel, until box3dvehicle's rule sets them each step; the spin motor on at
//                no torque, and the steering at `steering`'s numbers.
// Every body also takes the Vehicle's `bodies`.
