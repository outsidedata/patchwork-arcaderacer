// The browser half of box3dvehicle: every car of the scene drawn from its Vehicle in
// `world.box3dvehicle.vehicles`, the one its row's `vehicle` names and its server half builds the
// bodies and joints from, placed each frame by its rows. It needs
// render3d, and is listed after box3d and before render3d, so a frame draws the rows it was handed.
// The drawing is the look's: it follows the physics' sizes where a player sees them meet the world,
// the wheels, the springs and the body's outline, and dresses the rest.
//
// A car is, from `look` (each part in `look.paint`'s colour of its name):
//   the body     on the chassis row: the body's box in `body`, and on it, where the body has a
//                `cabin`, the cabin's hull in `cabin`; or, with `open`, an open jeep, every panel
//                rounded, built to the body's box round its cabin (a body with no cabin and an `open`
//                look throws on the frame it is drawn, naming the vehicle):
//                  the tub, one wall round the cabin and the back, `wall` thick, from the cowl (the
//                  cabin's front) back along each side, round the rear corners `corner` round and
//                  across the back; its rim rounded, a rib round it `rib.depth` proud and
//                  `rib.height` tall at `rib.at`, and its top dipping `door.drop` into a door each
//                  side from `door.from` to `door.to` along x, easing in and out over `door.ease`;
//                  a rubber floor `floor` thick in `trim`;
//                  the hood from the cowl to the grille, its top falling `hood.drop` toward the nose,
//                  its edges rounded `hood.round`, with a `dome` pressed up `height` in it, `inset`
//                  in from its edges; chrome hinges at the cowl and a rubber latch each side;
//                  a dash across the cowl's back `dash.depth` deep and `height` tall, its gauges
//                  facing the seats and a chrome grab bar before the right seat;
//                  two bucket seats in `seat` at the cabin's back (`seat`: `width` across, `depth`
//                  long, a cushion `base` thick, a back `back` tall leaning `tilt` radians with
//                  bolsters, a headrest `head` tall, 0 for none, every edge rounded `round`, on a
//                  pedestal), and with `bench` a bench across the tub behind them;
//                  with `tunnel` a hump `width` wide and `height` tall down the floor, and on it with
//                  `stick` a gear stick that tall;
//                  a steering wheel `steer` round before the left seat, on a column into the dash:
//                  the column is the body's, and the wheel (its rim, three spokes and hub) is a piece
//                  of its own on the chassis, `box3dvehicle.steer`, whose origin is the hub and whose
//                  frame is the chassis's pitched down the column, so its +x runs down the column
//                  into the dash, +y up the wheel's face and +z to the right; it turns with the
//                  steering (`lock`, below);
//                  a windshield `windshield.height` tall leaning back `lean` radians from the cowl,
//                  its `frame` of `trim` rounded at the corners with `glass` in it, chrome hinges at
//                  its foot, two wipers `wiper` long on it, and with `mirror` a mirror `size` across
//                  out `arm` on a chrome stalk each side;
//                  a roll bar `cage.height` over the cabin's back, tubes `cage.tube` round bent
//                  `bend` round at the corners, with legs back to the tub's rear corners, a bar each
//                  side to the windshield's top and `pad` thick padding along its top;
//                  with `rocker` a rubber rocker panel `height` tall and `depth` proud along each
//                  side, between the fenders where there are fenders.
//                An upper arm at each corner from the body's side to the spring's top mount, where
//                the mount is out past the side.
//   fenders      a fender over each axle's wheels in `body`, a band `thickness` thick `gap` over the
//                wheel's top where it rests, from the body's side out to `flare` past the wheel's outer
//                face, its edges rounded `round`: over an axle within `ease` of the nose a flat wing,
//                from the nose back to `gap` behind the wheel, then easing down over `ease` metres to
//                the axle's height; over any other a flare arched round the wheel `gap` clear of it,
//                from the axle's height behind it to the axle's height ahead, the arch a superellipse
//                of power `square` (2 round, squarer above). A wheel pushed in further than `gap` goes
//                up into it.
//   bumpers      a steel bar across the front and the back, `depth` deep and `height` tall at the
//                body's bottom, `overhang` past each side, its edges rounded `round`, in `trim`, with
//                `bolts` chrome bolt heads across each; with `hooks`, a tow hook in `hook` either side
//                of the front one, `hooks` from the middle.
//   grille       a panel `depth` thick in its `paint` across the nose, from the bumper to the hood (in
//                the open car's nose; ahead of the closed car's box), with `slots` rounded slots cut in
//                it `width` across and `height` tall, and the headlights' holes either side, a dark
//                radiator behind them.
//   lights       two round headlights either side of the grille (or of the nose's middle, with none),
//                each a chrome reflector bowl with a bulb in it under a lens `radius` round domed
//                `depth` proud, lit in `light`, in a chrome ring `bezel` thick; and at the back each
//                side a cluster in a housing of `trim`, `bezel` round its lenses, inside the tub's
//                rear corners: a tail light in `tail` `radius` × 2 tall, and under it a reverse light
//                in `light` `radius` tall; and with `parking`, an amber parking light `radius` round
//                in a housing `depth` deep under each front fender's nose, where it runs flat to the
//                front, glowing `glow`. Each headlight throws a beam, a spot light in `light` of
//                `beam.intensity` candela reaching `distance` metres falling off by `decay`, its cone
//                `angle` radians from its middle soft over its outer `penumbra`, aimed ahead `dip`
//                radians down. The tail lights glow `tail.glow` and, with the car braking (`pedals`,
//                `box3dvehicle.sim.ts`), up to `tail.brake` at a full brake, as the point light
//                behind the car in `tail` goes to `tail.light.intensity`; the reverse lights glow
//                `reverse.glow` and light theirs, in `light`, `reverse.light.intensity`, while it
//                drives backwards, and are dark otherwise; amber lenses glow `parking.glow`, three's
//                own 1 with no `parking`. Every light is made with the car (a model's beams with the
//                model, as it lands) and kept, at no intensity while off, so switching one never
//                changes how many lights a frame draws, and none casts a shadow.
//   spare        the last axle's wheel on the back, `lift` above the body's top, on a bracket.
//   model        `{ asset, at?, scale? }`: the loader catalogue's `model` entry `asset`, drawn on the
//                chassis row in place of the body, its cabin, the fenders, the bumpers, the grille,
//                the rocker panels, the spare and the lamps' housings and lenses, none of which is
//                then drawn; the wheels, the corners (springs, dampers, upper and lower arms), the
//                exhaust, the dust and the tracks are drawn as without it. Its origin is at `at` in the
//                chassis's frame ([0, 0, 0] when left out), `scale` metres to one of its units (1 when
//                left out), its +x the car's forward, +y up and +z its right, as the chassis's. It is
//                asked of the loader (`plugins.loader`, which the scene lists, or the frame throws
//                naming the vehicle) once, and taken with `model(asset)` the first frame it is ready;
//                until then the car is drawn with no body. Its own nodes place the lamps, by the
//                start of their names (glTF's `beam.L` reaches three as `beamL`): every node named
//                `beam…` throws a beam of `lights.beam`, a spot light where the node is, aimed along
//                the node's +x (its `dip` is the node's own turn); and every mesh named, or under a
//                node named, `tail…`, `reverse…` or `amber…` takes the car's tail, reverse or amber
//                lens material, glowing and lit as the drawn lenses are (below), the brake and reverse
//                lights moved to the middle of the tail and the reverse meshes. A look with `model`
//                and no `lights` has no lamps: no beams, and its lamp meshes keep their own
//                materials. Every other material of the model is dressed by render3d, once, and is the
//                loader's, never disposed here; every mesh of it takes shadows, and every one that is
//                not see-through casts them. Every node named starting `steer` (glTF's `steer` reaches
//                three as `steer`) that is not under another is a steering wheel, which turns with the
//                steering as the drawn one does (`lock`, below), about its own x: a model's steering
//                wheel is its own node, its +x down the column into the dash, +y up its face, +z right.
//   lock         radians the steering wheel turns at full lock, the car row's `steer` at ±1: each frame
//                the drawn wheel, and each of a model's `steer…` nodes, is turned `steer` × `lock` about
//                its column, from the way it was made, so a steer to the left (positive) turns its top
//                to the left; about its own −x, the column toward the driver. With none the wheel does
//                not turn.
//   points       `{ <name>: [x, y, z] | { at: [x, y, z], part?: 'steer', turn?: [x, y, z, w] } }`:
//                named places of the car in the chassis's frame, where a body sits, takes hold or puts
//                its feet. Each is drawn as an empty three.js object of its name: on the chassis, so
//                with the car still it is at the chassis row's place turned by its turn, plus `at`
//                turned by it; or, with `part: 'steer'`, on the steering wheel (the drawn one, or a
//                model's first `steer…` node, once the model has come), set back by the wheel's own
//                place and turn so that with the wheel straight it is at `at`, and turning with the
//                wheel. With `turn`, a quaternion in the chassis's frame, the empty is turned so (with
//                the wheel straight, for one on it): a hand bent onto it takes that turn. A `part`
//                that names nothing the look draws throws naming the point: on the frame the car is
//                made, or, for a model, on the frame it comes and has no `steer…` node.
//   exhaust      a list of tailpipes, each `{ at, dir, pipe, effect, rev? }`: a chrome tailpipe `pipe`
//                round ending at `at`, along `dir`, and particle3d's `effect` thrown from it, both in
//                the chassis's frame and turned with it every frame, for as long as the car is drawn;
//                and `rev` beside it while the car's row holds a throttle, stopped the frame it lets go.
//                Each pipe throws its own. Each is the page's own (particle3d's `emit`), left where it is
//                thrown, so a moving car leaves a trail, and stopped with the car. A scene whose look
//                has an exhaust lists particle3d after this plugin.
//   dust         `{ effect, clear, speed }`: particle3d's `effect` thrown from under each wheel while
//                it is on the ground, its lowest point within `clear` metres of the land's height there,
//                and either going faster than `speed` metres a second across it or its tread sliding
//                over it faster than that, spinning or locked; it is thrown at the ground under the
//                wheel, along the way the tread pushes the ground back (the tread's speed at the ground
//                less the wheel's, which rolling is back from the way it goes) and up by half as much,
//                and stopped the frame either is no longer so. The land is the one a mod hands it,
//                `world.box3dvehicle.mods: { land: '<a>' }` (terrain3d's, `terrain3d.box3dvehicle.ts`):
//                `land(plugins)` is an object whose `height(x, z)` is the ground there, and whose
//                `spray(x, z)`, when it has one, is what the ground there throws instead of `effect`:
//                an effect's name, false for nothing, undefined for `effect`; a wheel that rolls onto
//                ground that throws something else stops its effect and starts that one. `land` is
//                undefined until it has a ground. Until then, or with no mod named, no wheel is on the ground and no
//                dust is thrown. The plugin the mod is is listed before this one, so the land it asks
//                in its `afterTick` is this frame's, and a scene with dust or tracks that lists it
//                after, or does not list it, throws (`ahead`), as does one with dust on any of its
//                vehicles that does not list particle3d.
//   tracks       `{ colour, opacity, skid, slide, clear, step, life, max, lift }`: the track each tyre
//                leaves on the land, a ribbon its wheel's width laid `lift` metres over the land's
//                height under each edge, a piece every `step` metres the wheel goes while its lowest
//                point is within `clear` metres of the land, broken where it is not. A piece is
//                `colour` at the opacity the land's `mark(x, z)` gives where it is laid (the land a
//                mod hands, as dust's; `opacity` where it gives none, or has no `mark`), plus `skid`
//                while the tread slides over the ground faster than `slide` metres a second, a skid's
//                rubber or a spun wheel's rut, at most 1; a piece of no opacity is not laid, and
//                breaks the track. Each fades to nothing over `life` seconds from when it was laid,
//                and a wheel keeps its last `max` pieces, laying each new one over its oldest. A track
//                is the page's own, and goes with its car. With no land no tyre is on the ground, and
//                none is laid.
//   the wheels   each on its wheel row: a tyre of its axle's `wheel.radius` and `width`, revolved, its
//                sidewalls bulging and its shoulders rounding into the tread (with `tread`, `blocks`
//                chevron lugs round it `depth` deep, each half turned `angle` radians across it), on a
//                dished steel wheel `look.rim` of the radius with `look.spokes` ribs on its outer face,
//                as many chrome lug nuts round its hub and a chrome cap, so its turning shows.
//   the corners  between the chassis and each wheel, placed each frame from both rows: a coil spring
//                of `look.coils` turns, `look.coilRadius` round and `look.wire` thick, from the wheel's
//                inner face (level with the wheel's middle, along the chassis's side, so it does not
//                steer with the wheel) up to the spring's mount, stretched to the gap between them, so it
//                squashes as the wheel is pushed in; a damper, a sleeve hanging from the mount as long
//                as the spring at full bump and a rod from the wheel to the mount; and a lower arm from
//                the body's bottom edge to the wheel's inner face, where that is out past the side.
//                With `look.inboard`, the spring and the damper are drawn that many metres in toward
//                the body, out of the tyre: their foot that far in from the wheel's inner face and
//                their top that far in from the mount; the arms run to
//                those two points instead. Only the drawing moves: the spring pushes at its mount
//                (`box3dvehicle.sim.ts`).
//   solid        with it, each axle is drawn as a solid axle instead of the corners (no coil, damper or
//                arm at any corner, and no upper arm on the body): placed each frame from its two
//                wheel rows by `solidParts` (`box3dvehicle.sim.ts`, which says how every number below
//                is read), so it tilts as one wheel rises and the other falls and steers with them,
//                while the wheels still ride on their own springs. Its parts: a housing `housing`
//                round between the knuckles' pivots `pivot` in from each wheel's middle; the pumpkin, a
//                ball `pumpkin.radius` round at the axle's own `axles[i].pumpkin` along it, with its
//                `pinion` toward the driveshaft and a chrome cover `cover` round the other way; at each
//                wheel a knuckle `knuckle.radius` round and `height` tall, a brake disc `brake.radius`
//                round and `thick` thick `at` in from the wheel's middle with a caliper `caliper`
//                round on its top, all turned with the wheel's steering, inside the wheel's dish; four
//                links `links.radius` round, `lower` and `upper` each side, and the `track` bar, from
//                the chassis to the axle, each with a rod end `end` round on the axle; at each wheel the
//                `shocks`, each a body `radius` round and `body` long hanging from its top on the
//                chassis, a shaft `shaft` round from the axle up to halfway along the body, with `coil` a coil `turns`
//                turns `radius` round in wire `wire` thick between a perch `low` up the shaft and one
//                `high` down the body, never longer than its `free` length (past it, it rides on its
//                lower perch clear of the upper one), and with `reservoir` a can `radius` round and `length` long
//                `gap` beside the body; a bump stop `bump.radius` round each side `across` out, from
//                the `ceiling` down to where the housing's top is at full bump; a limit strap each
//                side, `strap.length` long, `width` wide and `thick` thick, from a tab `drop` under the
//                ceiling to the housing's top, straight once pulled tight and folded back and forth otherwise; on a steered axle a steering arm on each knuckle reaching `steer.arm`, a
//                tie rod `steer.rod` round between them and a steering ram on the housing pushing it;
//                and a driveshaft `shaft.radius` round from the transfer case's output at
//                `axles[i].shaft` to the pinion, a slip yoke `shaft.slip` at its start and a joint
//                `shaft.joint` at the pinion. Coils are in `spring`, the shocks' bodies, shafts,
//                reservoirs, the pumpkin's cover and the joints in `chrome`, the discs in `damper`,
//                the calipers and straps in `hook`, the bump stops in `trim`, and everything else in
//                `arm`. Each part is a mesh of its own on the chassis, named `box3dvehicle.solid.<part>`.
//   sound        `{ engine, stems?, ease?, at?, range? }`: the engine heard. `engine` is the loader
//                catalogue's `json` entry of its manifest (`Engine`, `box3dvehicle.sim.ts`), which the
//                library's `sounds/sounds.mjs` writes beside its loops, from a `piston` or `electric`
//                species: its layers, each the engine held at an rpm as the files of its stems (`on`, the
//                exhaust under load; `off`, on the overrun; `intake`; `mech`), and its `mix`. Each file is
//                read beside the manifest through the loader (`beside`) and decoded by the `sound` mod,
//                once a page however many cars share it. `stems` and `ease` lie over the manifest's mix,
//                one stem at a time, so a scene names an engine and gives only what it changes. Each loop
//                plays held going from the car's point `at` in the chassis's frame ([0, 0, 0] when left
//                out), placed every frame, through the `sound` mod, `world.box3dvehicle.mods: { sound:
//                'audio' }` (audio's, `audio.box3dvehicle.ts`), fading out over `range` metres in place of
//                the listener's own. It follows the car row's `rpm`,
//                which its petrol or electric engine writes each step: each stem's loop plays at the row's
//                rpm over its own, so the engine's pitch is the row's, and of the layers that give the
//                stem, the two either side of the rpm are heard, crossfaded by where it stands between them
//                at equal power (cos and sin of a quarter turn across the gap), every other at none. Below
//                the lowest only it is heard, as much quieter as the rpm is below its, none at 0, as a
//                motor standing still is silent; above the highest, only it. Each stem is as loud as
//                `stems.<stem>`, `[shut, full]`, makes the heard throttle: the row's (none below 0, the
//                brake), followed by e of the way every `ease` seconds of the page's clock (at once, left
//                out), so a stab at the throttle swells rather than clicks. A stem with no gain is not
//                played. The loops start once every one has come, and stop with the car; a manifest that
//                names a file not beside it is written to the console once, and its car stays silent. On
//                a page with no Web Audio, as in node, the mod is undefined, and nothing is read. A car
//                with a sound in a scene that lists no loader,
//                or names no `sound` mod, or whose engine writes no `rpm` (direct drive), throws on the
//                frame it is drawn, naming the vehicle.
// Round parts have `look.segments` sides and arms are `look.arm` thick. A car is drawn once its row
// names its parts and they have come, and goes with its row. When `world.box3dvehicle` changes, as
// the editor does while a value of it is dragged, every car is made again from it.
// Every part is a physical material in its paint, its finish `look.finish`'s for that paint
// (`roughness`, `metalness`, a `clearcoat` and its `clearcoatRoughness` for lacquered paint, a
// `sheen` and its `sheenRoughness` for vinyl, an `opacity` below 1 for glass and lenses, which are
// drawn see-through) and three's own for a paint it leaves out, dressed by render3d, so the sky's
// environment, its wet and its snow reach the car as they reach the ground; `light`, `tail` and
// `amber` glow in their own colour. The parts that never move against the chassis or a wheel are
// merged into one mesh a material, so a car is a few draws however many parts it has; the drawn
// steering wheel, which turns on the chassis, is merged so on its own.
// Every mesh takes shadows, and every one that is not see-through casts them.
// The lamps found by name: each beam's spot light is `box3dvehicle.beam`, the brake light
// `box3dvehicle.brake`, the reverse light `box3dvehicle.reverse`, and the drawn lenses of the tail
// and reverse lights `box3dvehicle.tail` and `box3dvehicle.backup`; a model's group on the chassis
// is `box3dvehicle.model`; the drawn steering wheel is `box3dvehicle.steer`.
//
// One of these per client: the cars drawn are this scene's. `point(id, name)` is the empty of the look's
// point `name` of the car whose `box3dvehicle` row is `id`, as it is drawn this frame (its world matrix
// this frame's once this plugin's `afterTick` has placed the car); undefined while the car is not
// drawn, for a name its look has not, and, for a point on a model's steering wheel, until the model has
// come. interact asks it through box3dvehicle's mod for it (`box3dvehicle.interact.ts`).
