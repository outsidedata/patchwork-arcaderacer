// The browser half of the player. Any function called on it becomes a message up the wire,
// carrying the name and the inputs, at this seat's player row, sent the moment it is called: a key
// that goes down between frames is in the truth's inbox before the page's loop runs its next step.
// A call made before the plugin has its wire, as an actor's setup makes on a client's first frame,
// is sent at its first `input` or `tick`.
//
// When. What is read once a frame (the gamepads, the repeat, `every`, and what the mouse, a drag, the
// hover, a stroke and the wheel added up to) is read in `input`, which a page whose loop steps the
// truth calls before its steps (`client.input()`, `engine/browser.ts`), as `index.html`'s and
// `client.html`'s do, so the steps it runs next take it. In a frame whose page calls no `input`, as a
// test's may, it is read in `tick`.
//
// This plugin runs no rule. A message goes up the wire and nothing else happens here. Where it lands
// first is the page's: on `index.html` the truth in the tab takes it on its next step; on
// `client.html` the copy that runs ahead (`addons/predict`) takes it on its next step and the seat's
// own `player` row is drawn from that copy the frame after the key, while every other row is drawn
// as the server's packets bring it. A message the pipe refuses is numbered 0 by `wire.send`, and is
// a press that never happened.
//
// One of these per client. The key table and the listeners on the page belong to the one scene it
// was made for, and go when the page closes that scene's client: a key pressed after the seat moved
// on cannot reach the rows of the scene it left.
//
// Keys, mouse and clicks. A game's player actor hands `bind` one table in its setup and holds no
// listener, no queue and no tick of its own. The plugin listens on the page, and a key that goes
// down in a field of the page, an input, a text area, a select or anything editable, is the
// field's and not the seat's, so typing in a panel beside the game plays nothing: a key in `press`
// sends its message the moment the key goes down, or, for a key `press` gives a function, runs it
// then and sends nothing, for what is the page's alone, such as a key of the store; `release` gives
// a key a function run when it comes up, or when the page lets go of every key, and a key it names
// is pressed once per hold, the keyboard's repeats of it running nothing, as a synth's note is; each `axis` is two keys whose held value,
// -1, 0 or 1, is sent through `send` when it changes; each `stick` is four keys, left, right, up
// and down, whose held value, an x and a y each -1, 0 or 1 with y growing down, is sent through
// `send` as one message when either changes, so a rule hears a way at once rather than two halves
// of it a message apart; each `hold` is a button of one or more keys,
// held while any of them is down, whose value, 1 held and 0 let go, is sent through `send` when
// it changes, so a rule can do a thing for as long as it is held; `every` is asked each frame (When,
// above) for a message from what is held; `click` is asked for a message from where the
// page was clicked, in the canvas's pixels: the page's CSS pixels divided by the renderer's
// `scale`, which is more than 1 when render2d's `fit` draws a canvas pixel across several. A mouse
// button is a key named `Mouse` and the button's number — `Mouse0` the left, `Mouse1` the middle,
// `Mouse2` the right — held while it is down and sent from `press` the moment it goes down. Each key
// an `axis` or a `stick` names may be a list of keys, any of which holds it: the arrows and w a s d
// for one stick.
// The scene's `ui` is asked first. A click, or a mouse button going down, over something on the UI
// that takes the pointer is the UI's: it is not held, sends nothing and asks `click` nothing. A
// key the UI took — every key while a modal has the input, but `world.ui`'s `back` key on a
// screen the game put up, which is the game's to bind — does not go down here. Each frame a modal has the input, every key
// and button held is let go, the way their release would, so an `axis` sends 0 and the seat stops,
// and a pointer lock this plugin took is given back, so the pointer can reach the menu; while the
// modal's backdrop covers the page, no click takes it again.
// A key is named by its place on the keyboard, the event's `code`, as `keyOf` names it: what that
// key types on a US keyboard without Shift, so `a`, `1`, `' '`, `-`, `Shift`, `ArrowLeft`,
// `Escape`. So it is one key with Shift down or not: `w` is held from its press as `W` to its release
// as `w`, and `1` from its press to its release as `!`. A key on another layout is named by where it
// is, so a table's `w a s d` are the same four keys under the left hand on every keyboard. A key with
// no place, as an on-screen keyboard's, is named by what it typed, a letter in lower case.
//
// Gamepads. Every gamepad connected is read each frame (When, above), and its buttons and
// its two sticks are keys like any other, in any table and with the same `press`, `axis`, `stick`,
// `hold`, `every` and `locked`: a key goes down the frame it is first seen down on any gamepad and
// comes up the frame none has it down, and has no repeat. A button is `Pad` and its number in the
// browser's standard mapping: `Pad0` the bottom face button (A on an Xbox pad, cross on a
// PlayStation's), `Pad1` the right, `Pad2` the left, `Pad3` the top, `Pad4` and `Pad5` the left and
// right shoulders, `Pad6` and `Pad7` the triggers, `Pad8` select, `Pad9` start, `Pad10` and `Pad11`
// the sticks pressed in, `Pad12` to `Pad15` the d-pad's up, down, left and right, `Pad16` the home
// button; a button is down while the browser calls it `pressed`. A gamepad the browser does not map
// to the standard numbers its buttons its own way. The left stick holds `PadStickLeft`,
// `PadStickRight`, `PadStickUp` and `PadStickDown` while it is pushed that way past
// `world.player.deadzone`, a fraction of the way out, each axis on its own, so a push both ways holds
// a diagonal; the right stick, the standard mapping's third and fourth axes, holds
// `PadRightStickLeft`, `PadRightStickRight`, `PadRightStickUp` and `PadRightStickDown` the same way.
// A scene that gives no `deadzone` reads no stick, and a table that names a side of either there
// throws. So `stick` keys of `[['ArrowLeft', 'a', 'Pad14', 'PadStickLeft'], …]` move a seat from the
// arrows, the keys, the d-pad or the stick. While a modal has the input no gamepad key goes down,
// and one down as it came up is held only on a new press. So is one already down the first time a
// client reads the gamepads, as a key of the keyboard held down as a page opens sends no keydown:
// the button that pressed a menu's button to move the seat presses nothing in the scene it moves to,
// whose UI has not ticked on its client's first frame.
//
// Analog. An `axis`, a `stick` or a `hold` read analog (`analog: true` on its entry in `bind`'s table,
// its action named in `control`'s `analog`) sends how far each key is held, not only whether: a key
// of the keyboard or a mouse button held is 1; a gamepad button held is its `value`, so a trigger
// sends from where the browser first calls it pressed to 1 at the floor; a side of a stick held is
// how far past the dead zone it is pushed, 0 at the dead zone and 1 at the rim. A side of an axis or
// a stick is the most any of its keys holds, and the value sent is the positive side's less the
// negative side's; a hold is the most any of its keys holds, and 1 while it is toggled on. Each
// value sent is a whole number of steps over `world.player.resolution`, a whole number above 0,
// rounded away from the middle at a half: a stick swept slowly sends one message each time it
// crosses a step, and one held still, however its reading wanders inside a step, sends nothing. A
// table that reads anything analog in a scene that gives no `resolution` throws.
//
// Rumble. `rumble({ strong, weak, seconds })` shakes the gamepad that last had a key go down (a
// button pressed, a side of a stick pushed past the dead zone) for `seconds`, its heavy motor at
// `strong` and its light one at `weak`, each 0 to 1, replacing a rumble it is playing. A key of the
// keyboard or a mouse button pressed since, or no gamepad used yet, and nothing shakes: a pad left on
// the desk while the player is on the keyboard stays still. Neither does a gamepad the browser gives
// no `vibrationActuator`, as Firefox gives none. It is the plugin's own and not a message, as `bind`
// is: what the page feels of the seat's own thing, which no other seat and no rule hears.
//
// Actions: the second avenue. `bind`'s table binds what a seat does straight to keys. `control`'s
// binds it to the scene's actions instead, and the scene binds the keys to the actions, so a player
// can change which keys play which action and the game never knows. The scene names each action in
// `world.player.actions`, fixed for the scene and so carried by no row, with the `label` a screen
// shows it by and its `keys`, whose shape is what it is: a list of keys is a button, held while any
// of them is down; two lists are an axis, the keys that push it to -1 and the ones that push it to
// 1; four lists are a stick, left, right, up and down. `control`'s table is `bind`'s keyed by those
// actions: `press`, `release` and `hold` name buttons, `axis` axes and `stick` sticks, `every` is
// handed whether a button action is held, `locked` names button actions, and `drag` and `stroke`
// each name the button action whose keys they follow; `click`, `pointer`, `hover` and `wheel` are
// as they are in `bind`; `analog` names the axis, stick and hold actions read analog (Analog, above).
// It throws on an action the scene does not name, on one whose keys are not the shape the part of
// the table naming it reads, and on an `analog` action no `axis`, `stick` or `hold` of it reads.
// `bind` and `control` each replace the other as the table in force, and `unbind` drops either. On
// this avenue:
// - the sticks read the store's `player.deadzone` over `world.player.deadzone`, as `bind`'s do;
// - a gamepad key going down is offered to the UI (`keyDown`, and `keyUp` as it comes up) before it
//   is the game's, as a key from the keyboard is, so a pad moves through the UI's menus;
// - what the player chose is the page's, never the server's: four keys of the store, which the
//   scene lists before `player`, or it throws, so the store has ticked when they are read. A scene
//   that lists no store plays the scene's actions and settings and changes none.
//   - `player.keys`, the actions rebound, each to keys of the shape the scene gives it; an action
//     it leaves out has the scene's.
//   - `player.toggle`, the button actions played as toggles: a press of one of its keys holds it
//     and the next lets it go, so a `hold` sends the 1 and the 0 a held key sends, and no rule can
//     tell. A modal, or the pointer lock lost, lets a toggle go as it lets a key go.
//   - `player.deadzone`, in place of `world.player.deadzone`.
//   - `player.repeat`, in place of `world.player.repeat` (0 when the scene gives none): the seconds
//     between presses while a `press` action is held. Above 0 the keyboard's own repeats press
//     nothing and the action is pressed again every that many seconds, the first that long after it
//     went down, from a gamepad as from a key; at 0 a keyboard's repeat presses it again, as
//     `bind`'s does. An action with a `release` is pressed once a hold either way.
// What a screen that shows and changes the actions calls, all of it on the page:
// - `actions()`: each action the scene names, in its order, with its `name`, `label`, `shape`
//   (`button`, `axis` or `stick`), the `keys` it has now, the scene's `defaults`, and `bound`, the
//   parts of the table in force that name it.
// - `listen(fn)`: the next key, mouse button or gamepad button that goes down is handed to `fn` and
//   to nothing else, neither the game nor the UI, and `listening` is true until it is; `Escape`
//   hands `fn` undefined, as does `unbind`, and a click after a mouse button it took is nobody's.
// - `rebind(action, keys)`: `player.keys` given the action's new keys, in its shape, or it throws.
// - `restore(action?)`: the action's keys and its toggle back to the scene's; with no action, every
//   action's, and the deadzone and the repeat.
// - `conflicts()`: each key more than one action holds, with the actions holding it.
// - `settings()` and `configure(changes)`: the toggles, the deadzone and the repeat in force, and a
//   change to any of them, written to the store. A toggle is a button action; a deadzone is above 0
//   and below 1; a repeat is 0 or more seconds.
// - `device()`: what was used last: `keyboard` (a key or a mouse button), `xbox` or `playstation`
//   by the gamepad's `id`, or `pad` for any other.
// Each is the plugin's own and not a message, as `bind` is.
//
// What it read. On either avenue, for a screen that shows what the plugin hears, a controls screen's
// or a debug view's, two reads, each the plugin's own and on the page alone:
// - `pads()`: every gamepad connected as the last read of the gamepads found it (When, above), in the
//   order `getGamepads()` lists them: `{ index, id, family, mapping, used, buttons, axes }`, its place
//   in that list, its `id`, its family as `device()` names one (`xbox`, `playstation`, `pad`), the
//   browser's `mapping` (`standard`, or `''` for a gamepad it does not map), whether it is the one that
//   last had a key go down (Rumble, below), each button's `pressed` and `value`, and each axis, −1 to 1,
//   as the browser gave them, before any dead zone. Each is a copy, the page's to keep. Before the first
//   read, or with no gamepad connected, it is empty.
// - `held()`: every key held now, by the name a table gives it (`ArrowUp`, `Shift`, `Mouse0`, `Pad7`,
//   `PadStickLeft`), in the order each went down: what `press`, `axis` and the rest are asked of, so a
//   key a modal has let go of, or a `locked` key without the pointer lock, is not in it.
//
// A key or a mouse button the table names anywhere has its browser default cancelled, as the wheel
// does when `wheel` is in the table: Tab would move the focus off the page, the right button open a
// menu, the wheel scroll it.
// With Control, Command or Alt down it keeps its default, the wheel too, so the browser's shortcuts
// (zoom, find, copy, and zoom on the wheel or a trackpad's pinch) still work on a page that binds the
// key; the game still hears it.
// `locked` names keys the game hears only while the page holds the pointer lock, pressed under it:
// without it they are not held and `press` hears nothing of them, and one already down when a click
// takes the lock is not held until it is pressed again. So a strike on the left button and a block
// on the right are the game's while the mouse looks, and a click without the lock only takes it.
// The frame the page loses the pointer lock, every key held is let go, as its release would, and
// each is held again only on a new press.
// With `drag` in the table, `{ key, send }`, the mouse's movement while that key is down and the
// page holds no pointer lock is added up, and `send` is asked once each frame for a message from the
// page pixels it moved across and down; a frame it did not move asks nothing. `wheel` is asked once each
// frame the wheel turned, for a message from the pixels it turned down since the last one.
// With `hover` in the table, it is asked once each frame the mouse moved without the pointer lock,
// for a message from where the pointer is now, `[x, y]` in the canvas's pixels as `click` has them,
// or from `null` the frame it went over something on the UI that takes the pointer, or off the page:
// what the pointer is over, a cell a tool would build on, is drawn from it.
// With `stroke` in the table, `{ key, start, move, end, cancel }`, a press of `key`, a mouse button,
// that is not the UI's begins a stroke: `start` is asked for a message from where it went down,
// `move` once each frame the mouse moved while it is down from where it is now, and `end` from where
// it came up, which ends it, over the UI or not, so a road is laid from where a drag began to where
// it ended. A stroke the plugin lets go of without its release, as a modal lets every key go, asks
// `cancel` and nothing more. Each is left out to ask nothing, and each point is in the canvas's
// pixels.
// With `pointer` in the table, a click on the page takes the pointer lock for the element
// clicked, and while the page holds the lock the mouse's movement is added up and `pointer` is
// asked once each frame (When, above) for a message from the page pixels it moved across and
// down since the last one; a frame it did not move asks nothing. The
// table in force is the last one bound; `unbind` drops it and the
// listeners, and gives back a pointer lock this plugin took. Where there is no `document`, as in
// node, or one with no pointer lock, as the one the loader lends node while a model decodes, nothing
// holds the pointer lock and there is none to give back.
