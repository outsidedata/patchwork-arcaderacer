# particle3d

3D particle effects for render3d: camera-facing quads from sheets or flat squares, bursts and
streams with speed, spread, gravity, drag, pull, pacing, spin, tint that cools, fade, additive
light and bloom-bright gain, stretch along the motion, beams and tracers to a target, particles that
carry real point lights, effects that fly and throw more where they land, effects that ride on a
row, and every seat drawing the same particles, all in one draw per sheet and blend.

## Why use it

Use particle3d for explosions, muzzle flashes, sparks, smoke, dust kicked up by wheels, exhaust,
blood and gore, magic, tracers and lasers, rain splashes, embers, a smouldering wreck, a comet's
trail. A particle is drawn and never read by a rule, so no particle is a row: a rule says once which
effect, where and for how long, and each page draws the rest from the same seed.

## How it works

**Server half (`particle3d.sim.ts`).** One `particle3d` row is the ledger: `next` and `live` and
nothing else. `emit(w, effect, at, spawn)` adds an entry at a world point `[x, y, z]` in metres (y up)
with the spawn's `life`, `dir`, `to`, `tint`, `scale`, `floor`, `from`, `fly`, `land`, and hands it
back; `entry(w, id)` finds it again, and a rule moves it by writing `at` or stops it by writing
`life`. Each step ages every entry and drops those past their life, or past `world.particle3d.hold`
when that is longer, so a page that takes two packets in a frame still sees it. An entry `from` a row
stays while the row is there.

**Browser half (`particle3d.plugin.ts`).** The page's own ledger of live effects. It takes each
ledger entry the first frame it sees it (rolling bursts it missed, so a late page draws what an
early one does), and anything on the page can `emit(...)` an effect of its own (box3dvehicle's
exhaust and dust, dismember3d's gore), seeded or not. Every particle is a quad facing the camera; all
the particles on one page of one sheet and one blend are one mesh whose buffers are written every
frame.

The effects are a data file (the loader entry `world.particle3d.effects` names) with `cap`,
`alphaTest`, `ppm` (sheet pixels per metre) and `effects`, each a list of layers. A layer
`{ "effect": name, "at"? }` reuses another effect; every other layer is an emitter, in metres and
seconds: `n`, `every`, `after`, `life` or `lasts`, `skip`, `sheet` and `clip` (with `play`), `size`,
`grow`, `dir`, `spread`, `speed`, `jitter`, `box`, `g`, `drag`, `pull`, `pace`, `follow`, `flips`,
`tint`, `tint1`, `gain` (above 1 brighter than white, for render3d's `bloom`), `a0`, `a1`, `fade`,
`spin`, `origin`, `add`, `stretch`, `face`, `beam`, and `light: { intensity, distance, decay }`, a
real point light on each particle (which needs lights3d). An unknown field throws, naming it.

## Using it

1. List `particle3d` before `render3d` (after it, particles face last frame's camera and that
   throws), add one `particle3d` row (`{ "next": 0, "live": [] }`), and give
   `world.particle3d: { effects, hold }`.
2. Write the effects file and catalogue it, with any sheets it names.
3. In a rule: `emit(w, 'blast', pos, { scale: 2, land: [{ effect: 'smoke' }] })`. On the page:
   `plugins.particle3d.emit('spark', at, { seed })`; `plugins.particle3d.has(name)`.

## Plugins it works with

- **render3d**: the scene and camera the quads face, and its `bloom` for bright particles.
- **lights3d**: draws every particle's `light`; particle3d throws when a layer has one and the scene
  does not list lights3d.
- **loader**: the effects file and the sheets.
- **box3dvehicle**: its exhaust and dust are particle3d effects.
- **dismember3d**: its sever burst and drip are particle3d effects.
- **particle2d** is the 2D counterpart.
