// The loader's extension: the Assets panel, the Sheets panel, the inspector's Clip section, the field
// types `loader.sheet`, `loader.palette` and `loader.type`, and the measure of a sheet's frames, which the Assets
// panel's read-back, the Sheets panel and a game's own tools all ask.
//
// The Assets panel (`loader.components.tsx`) is the catalogue of the scene `focus('loader')` says,
// or of another scene with a loader row picked in the panel: every entry with its type, url,
// preload and drawing fields, whether it loads, and for a sheet its read-back. Selecting a json or
// sheet entry selects its file, so the inspector shows the file and the Clip panel the sheet, and
// the panel follows the selection to an entry whose file another panel selects. An entry's fields
// are edited in place, each change one value of `world.loader.assets.<name>` in the file that
// gives the scene's `world.loader`, and an entry is removed with one such change.
//
// Whether an entry loads is tried one of two ways, and each is shown with the way it was tried.
// While the game view shows the panel's scene, through that client's own loader, as the game
// loads it: an entry `ready` there has loaded, and Try every entry `retry`s the rest, each coming
// to what `load` comes to, the loader's own message when it fails. Always, through its files, as
// far as the editor can tell without the game (`tried`): a json file reads and parses; a sheet's
// file, and every other pack of it, reads, parses and is read by `read`, whose throws are the
// loader's own words, and each page it names loads as an image; a palette reads as a GIMP palette
// (`gpl`); a tilemap reads as a Tiled map with every tileset it names (`readMap`), and each image it
// draws from loads; a pixels file reads as a PNG (`decodePng`); a texture loads as an image; a model's, a sound's or a bitmap font's file is in
// its folder. An entry neither way has tried is untried, and is never said to load. Check again tries
// every entry through its files anew and reads every sheet back again, its images read anew too.
//
// The read-back, the export's own, is `check` over every sheet of the catalogue, one at a time with
// the page let go for a turn before each (`turn`), each
// page's pixels read as the file holds them (`pixelsAt`, `editor/ui/pixels.ts`; `readBack`); it is kept by each sheet's url and text, so an
// edit to a sheet reads it back again. `travel`, the clips whose frames move across the ground on
// purpose, is the viewer's own, kept in the browser for each game (`loader.travel.<game>`); since
// `check` skips only a travelling clip's neighbours, the read-back is taken once with none, and a
// clip marked travelling drops its pairs' problems from it (`travelled`).
//
// A sheet from elsewhere on the machine comes in through the loader's routes (`loader.route.ts`):
// `look` says what it is, `copy` puts it and its pages into a folder of the repo and writes its
// catalogue entry. Add copies it into a folder and adds an entry for it, drawn as a sibling entry
// is. Swap copies it beside a sheet entry's file: when the copy has the entry's own file name it
// writes over the entry's files, which the running game reads anew; else the entry's url is set to
// it. Each is the one route, the files and the entry together, run as one change the editor can
// undo (`Edits.route`): the undo puts every file back as it was, or takes it away when it was not
// there, and a copy refused part-way leaves nothing written.
//
// A picture entry, a `pixels` PNG of the repo such as a ripper's page of a game's tiles, is cut into
// a sheet through the loader's `slice` route: Slice cuts it into the sheet it names, in tiles of the
// width it is given, with the ripper's marks in the colours it is given and sprites on no tile of
// the fewest pixels it is given, and adds an entry for the sheet, drawn as a sibling entry is, the
// one route as one change the editor can undo, which takes the sheet and its page away, or puts back
// any it wrote over, and the entry with them.
//
// What the Assets panel does is done by functions here, which it and its commands call alike: an
// entry's fields written, or the entry taken out, by `entryEdits`, which refuses a value the loader
// does not read; the game asked for its entries again by `tryInGame`, what it made of each kept for
// the session (`gameTried`), so the panel shows what a call asked; the travelling clips kept for
// the session and in this browser (`travelIn`, `travels`, `setTravel`); and how a sheet comes in,
// and why it may not, by `addPlan`, `slicePlan` and `swapPlan`, whose refusals disable the panel's
// buttons and are said beside them, then brought in by `addSheet`, `sliceSheet` and `swapSheet`.
// Its commands, for an LLM calling them (`editor/mcp.ts`): `loader.assets` answers a scene's
// catalogue as the panel shows it, each entry's fields, how it loads through its files and, while
// the game view shows the scene, through the game, and a sheet's read-back, or one entry with its
// read-back's problems and its slices; `loader.try` tries entries anew, through their files as
// Check again does, or through the game view's loader as Try every entry does, which awaits a frame
// of the view and is refused while it shows another scene; `loader.entry` sets, adds or takes out
// an entry; `loader.travel` says a clip travels, or no more; `loader.look` looks at a sheet on this
// machine; and `loader.add`, `loader.swap` and `loader.slice` are Add a sheet, Swap and Slice, each
// one undo. Every one but `loader.try` through the game works from the files, whatever the game
// view shows.
//
//
// The Sprites panel (`loader.components.tsx`) touches up a sheet's pixels a pixel at a time. On the
// sheets of the catalogue of the scene picked, or of the one whose catalogue has a sheet file
// selected, else of the one `focus('loader')` says, it shows the sheet a file selected names, else
// the one picked, and its frames: the frame picked is drawn upright at a whole-number zoom over a
// checker, a pixel of it a square, with a grid between them when it is drawn large, and the pixel
// under the pointer and its colour said; a right or middle drag moves it, so a frame drawn larger
// than the panel can be reached all over, and picking another frame or zoom puts it back. The
// pencil sets the pixels a press and a drag pass over, one line of them between two points the
// pointer was read at, to the colour, red, green, blue and alpha, so a colour of alpha 0 clears
// them; the picker, or the pencil with Alt, sets the colour to the pixel's. `B` and `I` pick the
// two, and each colour set is put first among the recent ones. The pixels set are the panel's until
// they are saved: kept for the game open, the session, a stroke at a time, each stroke one Undo
// stroke (Mod+Z on the picture) takes back, and Revert one more stroke that sets none, so Undo
// stroke takes a revert back too. Every frame is drawn with them.
//
// Save writes them onto the sheet's own pages, and Save as onto a copy of the sheet at the path
// given, every pack and page of it with it, named after it (`paint` of `loader.route.ts`), and, when
// asked, adds an entry for the copy by the name given to the catalogue, drawn and loaded as the
// sheet's own entry is, then shows it. Each is the one route as one change the editor can undo, the
// pages put back, or the copy and its entry taken away (`saveSheet`, `saveSheetAs`). A page written
// is read anew, by the panels (`readAt`) and by the running game (`extensions/datafiles`), which
// draws it at once.
//
// The Sprites panel's commands do what the panel does, for an LLM calling them (`editor/mcp.ts`):
// `sprites.sheets` and `sprites.frames` list the catalogues' sheets and a sheet's frames;
// `sprites.read` answers a frame's pixels upright, `#rrggbbaa` a row at a time, and `sprites.shot`
// the frame as a PNG, each with the pixels set; `sprites.show` shows a frame in the panel;
// `sprites.paint` sets pixels as one stroke, and shows the frame; `sprites.undo` and
// `sprites.revert` are Undo stroke and Revert; `sprites.save` and `sprites.saveAs` are Save and Save
// as, one undo each. What the panel shows, its strokes and its colour are the session's, so a call
// and the panel show and set the same pixels.
//
// The Sheets panel (`loader.components.tsx`) is the one clip viewer. On the sheets of the catalogue
// of the scene selected, else of the one the game view shows, else of the first scene with a loader
// row, it shows the sheet a row or a file selected names, and picks any `sheet` entry of that
// catalogue, an Aseprite or TexturePacker JSON or a Tiled `.tsj`, and lists its clips with their
// frames, how each plays (a tag's direction and repeat, a Tiled tile's animation) and how many runs
// it has, `<clip>@<k>` being run k; a filter narrows the list by name. It plays a clip as the game
// plays it: the loader's `read` of the files with the entry's `nearest`, `facing` and `palette`,
// and the loader's `play` a step of the game's `dt` at a time, so every frame shows for as many
// steps as it does in the game; it pauses, steps a frame on or back, and shows the frame's place,
// id and duration and the steps played. It draws the frame at a whole-number zoom with nearest
// filtering, on a checker or a colour, with the pivot as a cross, the foot line across it, the
// whole frame dashed and the pixels the frame keeps boxed. A frame packed turned is stood upright,
// and a trimmed one put back in its whole frame, as PixiJS draws them.
//
// The onionskin draws every frame of the run over the others, each in its own colour along a ramp of
// hues and added together, so where they agree is white and a frame the pack moved shows as a fringe
// (`editor/ui/onion.ts`); beside it, each frame's miss against the run's first at the whole-pixel
// shift that fits it best, and its `verdict`, by the measure below; a mirrored run's shift is
// mirrored with it. Facing shows the frame as the
// game draws it each way the sheet's runs face and, when the sheet mirrors, each mirror image,
// flipped; picking one plays that run that way. A sheet whose entry names a `palette` is drawn in it,
// or in any palette of the catalogue swapped for it colour for colour, as sprite2d swaps them.
//
// The clip list counts each clip's flagged pairs, over every run, and the run shown lists its own: a
// pair of neighbouring frames one drawing but `SLIP` pixels or more apart, or unrelated (`pairs`),
// in words; a pair apart is settled with one change, the later frame's anchor moved by the pair's
// shift onto the earlier.
//
// Edits are written into the sheet's files, one value at a time, each one undo: a frame's
// `duration`, that frame of every run of the clip, or every frame's to time a clip that has none; a
// tag's `direction` and `repeat`, every run's tag; where a frame stands, its anchor set or nudged a
// pixel, and a clip's pivot, every frame of the clip stood on one point of its whole frame, both by
// the one pivot writer: the fraction each frame's `pivot` (or `anchor`) is, a number at a time, in
// whichever pack holds the frame; and a slice's key (`sliceEdit`): with a slice picked, a pixel of
// the frame clicked keys the run's key of that slice on that frame at that pixel, a 1 × 1 `bounds`
// of the frame's whole picture as the export writes the muzzle, a slice by a new name made with its
// first key. `extensions/datafiles` refills the running game's copies, so the game view draws the
// change at once.
//
// What the Sheets panel reads, draws and writes is done by functions here, which it and its commands
// call alike: the sheet read from its files (`sheetFrom`), a frame drawn (`drawnOf`), the picture
// drawn on the panel's canvas or on a picture's pixels (`drawClip`, the design system's `raster`), and
// each edit's writes, refused where the panel offers no such edit (`durationEdit`, `tagEdit`,
// `anchorEdit`, `pivotEdit`, `settleEdit`, `sliceKeyEdit`), written by `sheetWrite`. Its commands,
// which work from the files whatever the game view shows: `sheets.clips` lists a sheet's clips as the
// panel does, or shows one clip, its timed frames, each run's places with the milliseconds and game
// steps each shows, its onionskin measures, flags and slice keys, where each frame stands, its ways
// and the palettes it may be drawn in; `sheets.shot` is a frame, or a run's onionskin, as the panel
// draws it, a PNG; and `sheets.duration`, `sheets.tag`, `sheets.anchor`, `sheets.pivot`,
// `sheets.settle` and `sheets.slice` are its edits, one undo each.
//
// Selecting a row that plays a clip, one that names a `sheet` of the catalogue and its `clip`, as
// sprite2d's and sprite3d's rows do, shows that clip in the panel at the row's frame and palette,
// facing the way sprite2d draws the row when the game view draws its scene; the inspector gets a
// section on such a row that names what it plays and shows the panel. A row of a kind sprite2d or
// sprite3d draws names them as that plugin reads them, from its kind's entry of `world.sprite2d` or
// `world.sprite3d` where that gives them (`plays`).
//
// What any extension asks of a catalogue it reads through the editor is asked here: a sheet entry's
// clips as the loader reads them, from files the editor has read (`clipsIn`) or once it has read
// them (`clipsReady`), and the files they are read from (`clipsFiles`); the catalogue's json entries, where a data file's names are named (`jsonsOf`,
// `jsonsRead`), and where in them a name is named (`namedIn`), which a name taken out is refused
// for unless the caller says to take it out all the same (`stillNamed`); what a survey of a file's
// entry says once every sheet it draws from has been read (`surveyedReady`); and a json entry that
// holds named lists of layers, a layer naming another list, as particle2d's effects and volley2d's
// patterns do, read, written a list at a time, a list renamed with every layer that names it, and
// its commands answered, as their panels and commands alike do it (`namedLists`), a panel's edits
// written as one change or refused (`putEdits`).
//
// The types: `loader.sheet` is a sheet entry of the catalogue of the owner's scene, else of the one
// `focus('loader')` says, a pick of the catalogue's sheets with a name not in it marked so;
// `loader.palette` the same of its palettes;
// `loader.type`, which an entry's `type` is wherever a scene's `world.loader` is shown, a pick of the
// types the loader knows.
//
// The measure (moved here from diorama's `tools/export.ts`, which exports every unit's sheet) is
// plain TypeScript over a page's RGBA bytes (`Pixels`), however they were read. It measures the
// pixels a frame keeps, stood upright as it is drawn, from its anchor: a trimmed frame's kept pixels
// where they were in its whole frame, and a frame packed turned turned back. A pixel is inked when its alpha is above 0; ink of
// pure black (0, 0, 0) is a baked shadow, which no body is drawn in.
//
//   slip     how two frames, each hung on its anchor, fail to overlap: every whole-pixel shift of
//            the second up to `SEEK` each way is scored by the share of the two frames' ink that
//            misses the other's, (|A| + |B| − 2·|A ∩ shifted B|) / (|A| + |B|), and the best shift
//            is the answer, of two as good the shorter. A miss of `ONE` or less is one drawing in
//            two crops; `apart` is such a pair whose best shift is `SLIP` pixels or more on either
//            axis, the packer's mistake and not the art's own sway; `unrelated` a pair whose miss
//            is `UNRELATED` or more even at its best shift, which says the frame list is wrong.
//            `verdict` says it in words: one drawing, unsure below `UNSURE`, two drawings (a
//            stride, a pump) below `UNRELATED`, else unrelated. Anchors are taken to the nearest
//            whole pixel, as pixel art stands on whole pixels. This is the one measure of frames:
//            the Sheets panel's onionskin, the read-back and a game's own tools all ask it.
//   feet     the row, in pixels from the top of a frame's whole picture as it is drawn, under its
//            lowest ink that is not shadow; and `shadow` the middle of the shadow ink under that,
//            where a hovering body stands. Undefined for a frame with no body in it.
//   stands   how a run stands on the line its anchors draw: `feet`, when its lowest feet are on it
//            and none below it; `shadow`, when that is true of each frame's ground instead, the
//            middle of the shadow under it where it has one, as a body that hovers stands; else
//            `off`, with how far below the line the lowest feet are (a negative number is above
//            it). A sheet that carries its own shadow, a clip whose every frame is drawn in shadow
//            ink alone, is drawn in the air over it: its runs stand `air`, where their anchors put
//            them, and the shadow clip itself is not measured.
//   check    the read-back of a whole sheet, as the export reads back what it wrote: every run of
//            every clip stands on its line, or in the air; no two neighbouring frames of a run are
//            one drawing left apart, nor unrelated, the last and the first of a clip that loops
//            counting as neighbours, except in the clips the caller says travel, whose frames
//            move across the ground on purpose, as a body falling does; and every slice keyed on a
//            run of a clip is keyed on every run of it, on the same frame of each. A sheet none of
//            whose runs stands on its line is not drawn standing at all, as a sheet of sparks is
//            not, and its lines are not checked.
