// melee3d: weapons held in a body's hands, swung through the world by the clips anim plays, and the
// limbs and blades they meet. Its server half (this file) knows where each blade and each limb stands
// on a step and what a swing passed through; its page half (`melee3d.plugin.ts`) draws them.
//
// A blade is a rigid weapon a body's rig names in its `blades`: one of the rig's `meshes`, measured
// by anim's bake into the rig's `grips` for each body as its guard and its tip on the joint that
// carries it (`anim.export.py`). A body holds a blade while its stance draws it (the rig's `show` for the
// row's stance lists it, or the rig has no `show`) and while it still has the limb the blade's bone
// hangs from: a hand cut off takes its sword with it.
//
// The fixed numbers of a scene are `world.melee3d`:
//   kinds    the kinds of body whose blades and limbs it knows, each an anim kind.
//   limbs    `{ <limb>: { from, to, radius } }`: a body's limbs as a blade meets them, each a capsule
//            of `radius` metres round the line from the bone `from` to the bone `to` of the posed
//            skeleton, named as dismember3d names its segments (`head`, `torso`, `armL`, …).
//   spacing  metres: the most between two points of a blade whose paths a swing follows.
//   edge     m/s: the slowest a point of a blade moves and still lands a blow; slower, a blade
//            resting on a limb or against another blade meets nothing.
//   clash    metres: how near the path of a point of one blade passes another blade to meet it.
//   show     `{ colour, radius, limbs?, struck? }`: the page half draws every blade as a rod of that
//            colour and radius, metres, from its guard to its tip, over everything else; with `limbs`,
//            a colour, every limb's line from bone to bone, and with `struck` too, a limb a swing in
//            play has met (a body's `struck`) in that colour; with no `show`, it draws nothing.
//
// The row of a body that swings carries, written here: `edges`, `{ <blade>: [guard, tip] }`, where
// each blade stood at the end of its last step; `swing`, the name of the swing it is in, or null; and
// `struck`, the `<id>:<part>` of every limb and blade the swing has met. A body's prefab starts them
// `{}`, null and `[]`.
//
// `blades(from, me)` is every blade the body `me` holds now, `{ blade, guard, tip }`, the two ends in
// the world, metres: none for a body lying limp, which no clip poses. The body is posed as anim's
// browser half draws it from the row's fields (anim's `posed`): every clip it blends, the upper body's
// gestures and the pinned hips, down the skeleton to the blade's bone, which carries the guard and the
// tip; then turned by the row's yaw and moved to its feet, as the row's `reads` name them.
// `limbs(from, me)` is every limb the body still has, `{ limb, a, b, radius }`, posed so, in the world;
// none for a body lying limp. A limb is lost when the row's `off` (dismember3d's) lists it.
// `swing(w, me, dt, live)`, each step of the body's rule once anim has posed it: where each blade
// stands now goes on `edges`. `live` is the name of the swing the rule says the body is in, or null:
// with none, nothing is met and `struck` is emptied; a name other than `swing` starts a new swing,
// with nothing struck yet. In a swing, each blade that stood somewhere at the end of the last step is
// followed from there to where it stands now: points along it, guard to tip, at most `spacing` apart,
// each moving straight from where it was to where it is. A path that passes within a limb's radius of
// its line meets that limb of another body of `kinds` that stands (not limp), and one that passes
// within `clash` of another such body's blade meets that blade, each where on its path it comes
// nearest, `u` of the way from the step's start to its end, moving at the point's speed, `|path| /
// dt`, and only at `edge` or faster. Each limb and blade a swing meets is met once: the first path to
// reach it, the soonest point of it. `swing` hands back what it met, soonest first: `{ what, id, part,
// point, dir, speed, u, blade }`, `what` `limb` or `blade`, `part` the limb or the other body's blade,
// `point` where the path came nearest, `dir` the unit way it moved, `blade` the swinging blade's name.
