# anim's export: a rig file's clips baked onto each body it names, one glb per body, and the rig's
# `table` measured. Run by the anim extension's route (`anim.route.ts`), or by hand:
#
#   Blender -b --factory-startup --python plugins/anim/anim.export.py -- \
#       <rig.json> <table.json> <body>=<out.glb> [<body>=<out.glb> ...]
#
# The rig file names its bodies, paths under the library, and the file of each clip, paths under
# ~/troupe-collection. The library is `PATCHWORK_LIBRARY` from the environment, else from the repo's
# `.env` (`.env.example` beside it lists the settings), else ~/patchwork-library; `~` in it is the
# home folder. A rigged character is `characters/<name>/<name>.fbx` in it.
#   bodies  `{ <body>: "<fbx>" }`, the rigged characters. Each `<body>=<out.glb>` names one of them.
#   spread  `{ <body>: <degrees> }`: that body's upper arms swung out from its sides on every frame,
#           turned about the body's forward axis in each arm's rest frame, after the clip's own turn.
#   size    times: every body of the rig is baked this many times its own size, 1 when left out. Each
#           object the body's file holds at its top is scaled by it before anything is written or
#           measured, so the glb draws the body at that size and the table and `ends` are measured
#           on it: a gear's speed, a one-shot's travel, the hips' height and every segment's ends come
#           out times `size`. It is the rig's, not a body's, since the table is measured once for
#           every body of the rig.
#   clips   `<name>: "<fbx>"` or `{ file, rebase, ... }`. A clip with no `file` (a `mirror`) is built
#           by anim itself and is skipped here.
#   blades  `[<mesh>]`: names of the rig's `meshes`, each a rigid weapon its body holds, measured as
#           a segment of that name beside the limbs' (below).
#   rebase  `{ from: "<fbx>", onto: "<clip>" }`: the clip is moved from the pose it was authored
#           around to the pose another clip starts in. Each bone's turn on each frame is taken as a
#           turn away from its turn on the first frame of `from`, and that same turn is laid onto the
#           bone's turn on the first frame of `onto`; the hips' position likewise. A pack's fire and
#           reload were authored around a rifle held 22 cm further forward than the locomotion pack's
#           aim, and on the upper channel that difference would jump the rifle on every shot.
#
# Every clip is sampled once, as each bone's position and turn from its rest (`matrix_basis`), and
# written onto each body as an action of its own name, one NLA track per clip, which the glTF
# exporter writes as one named animation. Only the hips keep their position keys: every other bone
# stands where its body's rest puts it, so a body of other proportions than the one the clips were
# pulled on keeps its own limbs. The bones are matched by name without the `mixamorig…:` prefix,
# which differs between packs.
#
# A body textured the specular/gloss way, as Adobe Fuse and Mixamo characters are, is turned into the
# metal/rough way glTF draws before it is written. Blender's FBX importer gives such a material
# Metallic 1 and feeds the gloss map straight into Roughness, so cloth and skin come out as polished
# metal with their shine inverted. A material whose Roughness is fed by an image named `gloss` is
# given: Metallic 0; Roughness from a copy of that image inverted (rough = 1 − gloss); no specular map,
# Specular IOR Level at its default 0.5; and its alpha from the image its Base Color reads (the
# importer reads it from a non-colour duplicate, `….001`, which glTF cannot pack), clipped at one half
# through a Round node, which the glTF exporter writes as `alphaMode: MASK`, or no alpha at all when
# that image is opaque. A material that is not so is left as it is.
#
# The table is measured on the first body named, once its clips are written, and written to
# <table.json> as `{ <clip>: { frames, dur, forward, left, yaw, rise, height, low, peak, travel } }`:
# forward is the body's own facing on the first frame (a Mixamo body faces −Y in Blender, +Z once
# exported), left is +X in that frame, yaw how far the facing turned by the last frame, positive
# left, rise the highest the hips got over their first frame, height the hips' height on frame 0,
# low how far they dip, peak the second the right hand moves fastest, and travel rows
# `[t, forward, left, yawDeg]` every tenth of a second and at the end. The route writes it into the
# rig file.
#
# Each body's bones are measured once its glb is written, frame by frame in every clip, and written to
# <table.ends.json> beside <table.json> as `{ <body>: { <clip>: { fps, <segment>: [[ax, ay, az, bx, by,
# bz], ...] } } }`, one row a frame from 0, which `merge-table.mjs` writes into the rig file's `ends`.
# A segment is two points: where its bone starts, and where the next bone down starts (the shoulder and
# the elbow for an upper arm, the elbow and the wrist for a forearm, the wrist and the middle fingertip
# for a hand; the hip and the knee for a thigh, the knee and the ankle for a shin, the ankle and the
# toe's tip for a foot; the skull's base and top for the head; the hips and the neck for the torso).
# Each is in the body's frame as anim draws it, glTF's axes (x the body's left, y up, z ahead), metres:
# a loop's hips are drawn at their rest across the ground plus their sway about the clip's steady
# progress (`anim.plugin.ts`, Pinning), so the steady progress, a straight line from where the clip
# starts the hips to where it ends them, is taken off every point, and the hips' rest put back. Every
# body is measured, not only the first: each keeps its own limb lengths.
# A blade (`blades`) is a segment too: its guard and its tip. Its mesh is the one object of the body
# whose name the rig's `meshes` pattern for it matches, every vertex of it weighted to one bone, which
# carries it rigidly. Its tip is the vertex furthest from that bone's head, its pommel's end the
# vertex furthest from the tip, and its guard the point of the line between them level with the
# vertex standing furthest off that line between the bone's head and the tip: the crossguard. Both
# are measured once in the bone's rest frame and carried by the bone on every frame.
#
# Each blade's guard and tip are measured again in the frame of the exported glb's joint that carries
# it, read off the glb's nodes before it is packed, and written to <table.grips.json> as `{ <body>:
# { <blade>: { bone, guard, tip } } }`, which `merge-table.mjs` writes into the rig file's `grips`. The
# server poses a body off the packed glb itself (`anim.sim.ts`, `posed`) and carries each blade on its
# joint by these. The bake stops if the glb's hips at rest stand more than a millimetre from Blender's.
#
# Each glb is packed by the native gltfpack (`GLTFPACK` from the environment or the repo's `.env`, else
# `gltfpack` on the PATH; `yarn health` checks it) before it is written to its <out.glb>: meshopt compression (`-cc`), every named node, bone and
# material kept (`-kn -km`), and translations at 20 bits (`-at 20`), since at its default 16 the hips
# of a run land up to 10 mm from the export's and at 20 within 0.6 mm, for 1.7 KB; rotations at its
# default 12 bits are within 0.1° of every bone of every clip. The loader decodes it with three's
# meshopt decoder. gltfpack keeps a skinned mesh's named node as an empty parent and puts the mesh on
# a new unnamed child, which carries the scale its quantized positions are read back by. Three's glTF
# loader names the mesh it draws after that child, and anim matches a rig's `meshes` against the
# names of the meshes it draws, so each name is moved from the parent onto its mesh's node: the parent
# is left unnamed, since a second node of the same name would make three call the mesh `<name>_1`.
