// The asset workshop's server: where a game's props are made and fitted to the game, with no game
// running. Run as
//
//   node --experimental-strip-types tools/workshop/workshop.server.ts
//
// and open http://localhost:5180/?game=<game>. A game is read from its own files and nothing else:
// its manager scene, `games/<game>/<game>.scene.json`, and each scene that names (`scenemanager`'s
// `scenes`), or the manager alone when it names none, each scene loaded whole by scenemanager's own
// `child` (`loaded.ts`): the manager's world and prefabs under it, and the partial it `extends`
// between, so a model, a body or an IK a scene has from its partial is found. The workshop writes back
// into those same files, a value into the file that gives it (a scene's, or its partial's),
// so what it shows and what the game plays never disagree, and moving a prop to another game is
// writing that game's files. A game's models are of two kinds: a glb (a loader `model`), which a body
// can hold and whose empties are its mount points, and a solids model (a loader `json` the solids
// plugin's meshes are made from, drawn by the solids plugin or by the game's own plugins through it),
// whose nodes and empties are its points. A machine with interactions is of two kinds: a solids model
// (mech's jimmy), whose points are its empties, written into its json (`/api/frames`), or a vehicle of
// box3dvehicle's fleet (vehicles's jeep), whose points are its look's `points`, written into the scene
// file that gives the look (`/api/vehicle`).
//
// It serves:
//   /                    the page, `workshop.html`, and `/<name>.ts` of this folder with its types
//                        stripped (node's `stripTypeScriptTypes`), so the page is TypeScript.
//   /three/…             `node_modules/three`.
//   /npm/…               `node_modules`, for the packages core's browser code imports by name
//                        (the loader's `fflate` and `fzstd`), which the page's import map points here.
//   /engine/…, /plugins/…, /addons/…   core's own files, `.ts` with its types stripped: the page
//                        draws with the game's own plugins, loader, anim, ik3d and render3d, and
//                        loads the mods its scene names through scenemanager's `prepare`.
//   /games/…             a game's files as they are, which the game's catalogue names by these paths.
//   /packs/<pack>/<clip>.fbx   a clip of Bill's Mixamo packs (PACKS), read no deeper than a pack.
// Every path is resolved inside its folder, and one that resolves outside it is refused.
//
// It answers:
//   GET  /api/games            the games: each folder of `games/` with its manager scene.
//   GET  /api/game/<game>      the game as the page draws it (`summary`).
//   GET  /api/packs            each pack and its clips.
//   GET  /api/notes?file=<path>, POST (a note), PATCH /api/notes/<n>?file=<path> (`status`, `reply`):
//                              a model's notes, `<stem>.notes.json` beside its file: its glb, or its
//                              solids model's json (`strider.model.json`, `strider.model.notes.json`).
//                              A note is `{ text, at, mesh, material, camera }`: the point in the
//                              model's frame, the mesh (a solids model's: the node its part hangs in)
//                              and the material (a solids model's: the paint), and the camera.
//   GET  /api/points?file=<path>, POST `{ points }`: a glb's empties, read and written in it (`glb.ts`).
//   GET  /api/frames?file=<path>, POST `{ nodes?, empties?, turns? }`: a solids model's nodes (`at`,
//                              `turn` [rx, ry] radians), empties and the empties' turns (quaternions,
//                              as a glb's), read and written in its json in place, its layout kept
//                              (`solids.ts`); a node or an empty it lacks is added.
//   POST /api/fit/<game>       `{ body, prop, hold?, ik? }`: how a body holds a prop, written for
//                              every scene of the game that draws the body and has the prop, into the
//                              file that gives each value, a scene's or its partial's (`fitting`,
//                              `scenes.ts`'s `fit`), adding the prop to a body that held none; a 409
//                              when a partial's scene draws the body and lacks the prop.
//   POST /api/bring/<game>     `{ from, key, body?, like? }`: the glb model `key` of the game `from` brought
//                              into this one: its glb copied to `games/<game>/assets/`, a catalogue
//                              entry of that key added to every scene file and partial that draws
//                              with anim, and with a
//                              `body`, that body given it held as `from`'s body `like` held it (its
//                              hold and its IK), the starting point to fit it from.
//   GET  /api/vehicle/<game>/<vehicle>, POST `{ empties?, turns? }`: a box3dvehicle vehicle's points,
//                              its look's `points` (`summary`'s `vehicles`), read as a solids model's
//                              frames are, `{ nodes: {}, empties, turns }` (each point's `at` in the
//                              chassis's frame, and the quaternion `turn` of each that gives one), and
//                              written in place into every file that gives the look (`vehicleFiles`,
//                              `scenes.ts`'s `points`), its layout kept; a point it lacks is added. The
//                              POST hands back the points and `written`, the files it changed.
//   POST /api/interaction?file=<path>   an interaction (`plugins/interact`), checked and written into
//                              its `.interaction.json`, each step on lines of its own.
//   POST /api/bake/<game>      `{ body, clip: "pack:<pack>/<file>", name }`: a pack clip added to the
//                              body's rig as `name` and every body of the rig baked again (`baking`).
//   GET  /api/events           server-sent events: `changed <path>` for each file of `games/` written,
//                              150 ms after its last write, so a half-written export is not read.
// `start({ port, root, packs })` runs it on any port against any root, which is how its test runs it.
