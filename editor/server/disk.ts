// What happens on the disk and in the change log, and what the editor's pages are told of it. Vite
// runs with no HMR (`server.ts`), so nothing else tells a page that a file changed, and a page holds
// every module it has imported as it was until it reloads.
//
// Every change, undo and redo the change log applies (`changes.ts`) is told to every page but the one
// that sent it, which takes it in from its answer: `editor:changed { id, by, version, files, at }`
// (`Applied`), `by` the id of the page that sent it, `at` when it was applied, by the machine's clock,
// and `files` each file it wrote with its text now, as the answer has them. A page is told the files of
// its own game and of no game, and nothing of a change that wrote neither (`applied`).
//
// Every file the server writes, for the change log or for a request outside any change (a whole file
// put, `PUT /api/files`, or a route asked by a plain request, the simulator's run say), is taken in anew
// by Vite at once, so a page that reloads right after reads it as written; and it is kept by a hash of
// what it holds, when it was written and whether the change log wrote it (`wrote`), until the watcher
// sees the file hold something else. Vite's watcher sees every change to the repo, the server's and
// anyone else's: a person's text editor, an LLM writing files, git; and may see one more than once.
// Vite is made to take a file in anew as the watcher sees it change, before anything else is done of
// it. Once a file has been still for `STILL` ms:
//   - a file as it was when it was last still, by its inode, its size and when it was last written,
//     is no change: the watcher saw it again, as it may for one write, or after it missed some under
//     load, and it is told and counted nothing more;
//   - a file that holds what the change log last wrote there is the log's own, which the pages were
//     told of as `editor:changed`, and is told nothing more;
//   - any other change is one no change made: it is counted (`Changes.outside`) and told to every page
//     with its game open, or every page for a file of no game, as `editor:disk { path, added, gone }`,
//     the page whose plain request wrote it too, which takes it in as it takes in any other; a write of
//     the server's once, however often the watcher sees it. A page that began to load after the file
//     came to be as it now is read it so, and is not told: one the server wrote came to be so when it
//     was written, which is before a page that reloads for that write began to load; any other change
//     when the watcher saw it.
// A page decides for itself whether it holds a file as a module, and reloads for it (`Editor`). A game
// running on node starts again on a change to a file it may run (`runs`), whoever made it, the change
// log too: its own game's, or the shared code every game runs; one that will not start again says why
// in its log (`servers.ts`).
//
// What Vite would say to a page over its own socket, which it has none of here, is said on the
// editor's: a reload (`editor:reload`), which Vite asks for when it has bundled a dependency it found
// anew, so every module that imports one is read again, or when its config changed; and an error
// (`editor:error`), a module that does not compile, to the pages of its game, or every page for a
// module of no game.
//
// A page is told nothing before it has said which page it is (`pages.ts`). As it says so, it says
// when it began to load (`editor:page { since }`, the page's own time origin, on the machine's
// clock), and is told then everything said since then that was for it (`Told`): a change it may have
// read the files before, a reload Vite asked for as its own imports set one off. Whatever was said is
// kept for `KEPT` ms.
